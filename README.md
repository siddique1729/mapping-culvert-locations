# mapping-culvert-locations

## Project Objectives

* Use the National culvert rating dataset provided to you:
* Model the Culvert Condition ( Unsatisfactory – 0: 5 and Satisfactory 6 and above).
* Use stratified random sampling to extract 10% of the culverts from each state
* identify ‘important features’ for subsequent modeling. 
* Map national culverts distribution
